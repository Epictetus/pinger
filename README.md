# Pinger

## What is it?

Pinger is a web application that let's you schedule HTTP requests and setup alerts based on the responses.

## Why would I use it?

Pinger is a good open source alternative for website monitoring. Set up an alert to notify via email when your site is down.

## Running on Heroku


## Technologies

Pinger is built on, and makes use of:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) - the web application framework
* [Resque](https://rubygems.org/gems/resque) - background job queueing, scheduling and processing
* [Cucumber](https://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber) - high level, acceptance-style testing
* [RSpec](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec) - low level, unit-style testing

## Notes

Although Pinger is at a fairly stable version, it is very much a work-in-progress application. Contributions are very welcome.
